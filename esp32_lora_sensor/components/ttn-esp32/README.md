# ttn-esp32

**The Things Network device library for ESP-IDF (ESP32) supporting devices with Semtech SX127x chips**

This ESP32 component provides LoRaWAN communication with
[The Things Network](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/). It supports:

- OTAA (over-the-air activation)
- uplink and downlink messages
- saving the EUIs and key in non-volatile memory
- deep sleep and power off without the need for rejoining
- [AT commands](https://github.com/manuelbl/ttn-esp32/wiki/AT-Commands) for provisioning EUIs and key
(so the same code can be flashed to several devices)
- support for regions Europe, North and South America, Australia, Korea, Asia and India
- C and C++ API

The library is based on the LMIC library from IBM (specifically the well-maintained version by MCCI
â€“ see their [GitHub repository](https://github.com/mcci-catena/arduino-lmic)) and provides a high-level API specifically targeted at The Things Network.

## New in version 4.x

- Support for deep sleep and power off (see [Deep Sleep and Power Off](https://github.com/manuelbl/ttn-esp32/wiki/Deep-Sleep-and-Power-Off))
- Verified compatibility with ESP-IDF v4.3 and 5.0
- Upgraded underlying library mcci-catena/arduino-lmic to v4.2.0-1
- C API
- Support for sub-bands
- Dropped support for *Makefile* builds
